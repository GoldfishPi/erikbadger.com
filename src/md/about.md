I am a software developer with a strong passion for creating data-driven user interfaces that effectively communicate complex information in a clear and concise manner. My work thrives at the intersection of elegant front-end design and robust back-end development, where I aim to deliver seamless, high-performance experiences that prioritize clarity, usability, and visual appeal.

Currently, I serve as a software engineer at Crosswalk Labs, where I focus on maintaining the front-end architecture while also contributing to back-end development. Our mission is to provide reliable, actionable insights on greenhouse gas emissions, ensuring that timely and accurate data is accessible for informed decision-making.

Outside of work, I enjoy reading, rock climbing, and exploring new landscapes to capture through photography.
