I Collaborated with design and product teams to re-architect the product using a modern framework, enabling language localization and enhancing accessibility. This transition also shifted the focus from social media and news analytics to consumer packaged goods. I implemented visually engaging D3.js charts to deliver insights, ranging from sentiment analysis of social media and news to AI-driven insights on market performance. Throughout the process, I facilitated clear, concise, and effective communication within the front-end team and across the broader company.
