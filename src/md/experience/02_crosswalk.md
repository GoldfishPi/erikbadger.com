I build and maintain the front-end for a range of applications, including the public-facing platform, a custom client portal with authentication, and the company’s branding website. I collaborate closely with cross-functional teams—including developers, scientists, designers, and managers—to ensure seamless integration and a cohesive user experience across all platforms.
