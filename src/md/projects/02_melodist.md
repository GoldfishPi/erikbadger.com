This is a fork of the front-end framework used at Tickr Composer, created to introduce concepts such as a functional component system and add XDOM utilities, all while maintaining compatibility with Backbone-style data structures, including models and collections. Would I choose it over a modern framework? Definitely not! However, it's been an enjoyable experiment to work with these "low-level" concepts that we often take for granted in today's modern tools.
