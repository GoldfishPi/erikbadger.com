This is a fork of the front end framework we use at Tickr Composer.
The porpose of this fork was to introduce concepts like a functional  component system and add xdom utilities while maintaining support for  backbone like data structures such as models and collections.
Would I ever use it over a modern framework? No absolutely not! But it's  really fun to mess around with these "lower level" concepts we take for  granted in our modern tools
